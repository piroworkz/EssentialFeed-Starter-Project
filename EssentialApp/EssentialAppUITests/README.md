# EssentialAppUITests

## Purpose
EssentialAppUITests contains the template-driven UI automation bundle generated by Xcode. It currently focuses on verifying launch and measuring startup performance for the host application.

## Architecture
Each test launches `XCUIApplication` with the production configuration. The suite disables `continueAfterFailure` in `setUp` to stop at the first failure and uses `XCTApplicationLaunchMetric` to profile launch times. Extend these tests when adding UI regression checks that are cheaper than full acceptance coverage.

## Next steps
Replace the placeholder `testExample()` with assertions tailored to the features you want to guard. Prefer high-level flows (login, navigation, etc.) that provide broad coverage without relying on internal implementation details.
